<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Moreover, you can choose between yarn or npm/npx. And you can give the name to your project.

##### Step 3 | Add Components and Pages

Here you can add all the component Names with their type, and you can select whether a component is a page or not.

_Note: Routing will only be done between components marked as pages_

##### Step 4 | Add routing

You can enable routing in your app from here. And you can select which component to use as Navigation Component or you can say Navigation Bar.

NOTE : _Don't remove `react-router-dom` dependency if you enable routing_

##### Step 5 | Build your App

Once you click on **Create App** It will download a js file and will give you a script

You would need to place that js file in the folder you want to create the react app and run the script there.

##### Final Result

You have successfully created your react app with desired preferences.

The folder structure generated with App.js on following the above steps looks like this.
